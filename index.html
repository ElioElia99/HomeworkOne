            <h2>How This Started</h2>
            <p>Elio has an ego the size of the planet itself, so when a project came in his class to design a website of his choice, he decided to go with one about his favoirte person in the world...him(He needs to get over himself). Now, as dedicated followers of Elio, we continue to look after and maintain the website for him, in hopes one day he may notice us.</p>
